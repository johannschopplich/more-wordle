# Wordle PWA

A refactored and extended Vue app of [VVordle](https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-wordle) by Evan You, which itself is a implementation of the original [Wordle game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

## Key Features

- üê§ Beautiful interface
- üéû Custom answer sources (environment variables or Google Spreadsheet)
- ‚å®Ô∏è Optional `umlauts` keyboard layout
- üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Styled with [UnoCSS](https://github.com/unocss/unocss)

## Setup

1. Enable [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) using `corepack enable` (use `npm i -g corepack` for Node.js < 16.10)
2. Install dependencies using `pnpm install`
3. Start the development server using `pnpm run dev`
4. Visit [127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173/)

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Enable [Take Over Mode](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#takeover-mode) in Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

### Start Date

Especially for a custom word list you probably prefer to start the list by a date of your choice. Wordle PWA will calculate the difference between the current date and the start date and pick the answer at the array index based from the date difference.

```
VITE_STARTS_AT=2022-12-01
```

### Base64

You can make your own one-time Wordle and send it to friends by base64-encoding a word and include it as the URL query, e.g. [`adventskerze.netlify.app/?anVsaWE=`](https://adventskerze.netlify.app/?anVsaWE=). This will also allow words that are not in the dictionary.

### Custom Word List

#### Within `.env` File

A custom word list may be set in the app's `.env` file:

```
VITE_ANSWERS=first,other,third
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Remember to set a start date as well.

#### Words From Google Spreadsheet

Alternatively, the app will fetch words from any public Google spread sheet if the following entries exist in the app's `.env` file:

```
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
VITE_SPREADSHEET_ID=1nO4y9FBuOr4_lA50rIldeWUAvqKYpcJYf5h1tpBybZU
VITE_SPREADSHEET_SHEET=Advent 2022
```
